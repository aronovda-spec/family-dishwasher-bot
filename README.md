## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot Token Error**:
   - Make sure you've set the TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN environment variable
   - Verify your bot token is correct by checking with @BotFather
   - Restart the bot after setting the environment variable

2. **Commands Not Working**:
   - Check if you're authorized (for queue commands)
   - Verify you're using the correct command syntax
   - Make sure you're an admin (for admin commands)

3. **Data Not Saving**:
   - Check Supabase connection and credentials
   - Ensure SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY environment variables are set
   - Verify Supabase database is accessible and tables exist

4. **Persistence Issues**:
   - Check Supabase connection status in console logs
   - Verify bot loads data on startup (look for "Bot data loaded from Supabase" message)
   - Ensure optimized auto-save is working (check console for "Optimized auto-save cycle completed" every 10 minutes)

### Getting Help

- Use the `help` command to see all available commands
- Check the console output for error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your bot token to version control** - always use environment variables
- Admin commands should only be used by trusted users
- Regular backups are automatically created in the `data/backups/` directory
- Keep your bot token secure and don't share it publicly
