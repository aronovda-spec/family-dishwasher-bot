A comprehensive Telegram bot for managing dishwasher queue with turn tracking, punishments, and admin controls.

## Features

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Automatic retry mechanisms with smart notifications for database failures
- **Server Restart Survival**: Bot state preserved across server restarts and deployments
- **No Reauthorization**: Users and admins remain authorized after restarts
- **Turn Order Preservation**: Queue order and scores maintained across restarts

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations
- **Optimistic UI**: `/done` and force swap commands provide instant feedback with background database operations
- **Database Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry attempts (2 attempts + 5-second scheduled retry) for failed database saves
- **Smart Error Notifications**: Only admins get technical error details; affected users get final failure notifications
- **Batch Database Operations**: Reduces database load by ~70% through intelligent batching
- **Parallel Database Reads**: `/status` command uses parallel reads for ~60% faster responses

- **HTTP Keep-Alive**: Maintains persistent connections to Telegram API for better performance

### üö® Anti-Cheating System
- **Rapid Activity Detection**: Monitors `/done` and `/assist` commands for suspicious patterns
- **30-Minute Rule**: Dishwasher cannot be completed twice within 30 minutes (physical impossibility)
- **Admin Alerts**: All admins receive immediate notifications about suspicious activity
- **Command Tracking**: Both user `/done` and admin `/assist` commands are monitored equally
- **No Blocking**: Commands still execute but admins are alerted to investigate
- **Global Tracking**: System-wide monitoring prevents rapid completions by any user

### üö® Debt Protection System
- **Debt Detection**: Users with significantly lower scores cannot leave the bot
- **Prevents Score Reset**: Blocks users from escaping their dishwasher responsibilities
- **Grace Period**: Legitimate users get 24-hour grace period for rejoining
- **Score Preservation**: Users can rejoin within 24 hours with their original score
- **Admin Override**: Admins can still remove users if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot Token Error**:
   - Make sure you've set the TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN environment variable
   - Verify your bot token is correct by checking with @BotFather
   - Restart the bot after setting the environment variable

2. **Commands Not Working**:
   - Check if you're authorized (for queue commands)
   - Verify you're using the correct command syntax
   - Make sure you're an admin (for admin commands)

3. **Data Not Saving**:
   - Check Supabase connection and credentials
   - Ensure SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY environment variables are set
   - Verify Supabase database is accessible and tables exist
   - Bot automatically retries failed database saves (2 attempts + 5-second retry)
   - Admins receive notifications about database issues; users get final failure notifications

4. **Persistence Issues**:
   - Check Supabase connection status in console logs
   - Verify bot loads data on startup (look for "Bot data loaded from Supabase" message)
   - Ensure optimized auto-save is working (check console for "Optimized auto-save cycle completed" every 10 minutes)

### Getting Help

- Use the `help` command to see all available commands
- Check the console output for error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your bot token to version control** - always use environment variables
- Admin commands should only be used by trusted users
- Regular backups are automatically created in the `data/backups/` directory
- Keep your bot token secure and don't share it publicly
